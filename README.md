# Reddit Meme Downloader (r/memes)
A simple piece of code written in Python 🐍 using **Selenium**, that downloads the first post from *"r/memes"* and saves it to the project folder.</br>
This partiular code works using the Chrome Web Driver so it works only if you have Google Chrome version 110. I will keep updating the webdriver and this code to support the upcoming versions of Chrome.</br>
This can also be used to download the first post from ANY sub-reddit by simply pasting the link of it in the "driver.get" code section </br>
I do not **think** that there is any danger of getting your account banned by using this piece of code, however, I will not be responsible for that if it does happen.
