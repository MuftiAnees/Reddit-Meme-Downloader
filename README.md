# Reddit Meme Downloader (r/memes)
A simple piece of code written in Python üêç using Selenium, which downloads the first post from "r/memes" and saves it to the project folder.
I do not think that there is any danger of getting your account banned by using this piece of code, however, I will not be responsible for that if it does happen.
