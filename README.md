# Reddit Meme Downloader *(r/memes)*
A simple piece of code written in Python 🐍 using **Selenium**, that downloads the first post from *"r/memes"* and saves it to the project folder.</br></br>

This partiular code works using the Chrome Web Driver so it works only if you have Google Chrome version 110. I will keep updating the webdriver and this code to support the upcoming versions of Chrome. If anyone wants me to write the code for Firefox let me know and I will make that happen as well. 😁</br></br>

This can also be used to download the first post from **ANY** sub-reddit by simply pasting the link of it in the *"driver.get"* code section. 😎</br>

If a meme is already present in the folder prior to running the code it is replaced by a new meme if available on the sub reddit after the code is ran.</br></br>

## Disclaimer</br>

I do not **think** that there is any danger of getting your account banned, ip blocked etc. by using this piece of code. However, I will not be responsible for those if anything does happen.</br></br>
